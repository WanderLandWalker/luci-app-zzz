## How to use

- Step 0: Please ensure you have an ``OpenWRT router``. ``Download the .ipk or .apk`` file from the Releases section of this project, ``upload it, and install it`` into the system packages in the Luci backend. Alternatively, ``add the project's source`` to your router; see the bottom of this readme for details.
- Step 1：Fill in the user name: Student ID@operator. For example, ``212306666@cucc``, China Unicom is cucc, mobile is cmcc, and telecom is ctcc.
- Step 2: Fill in the password. The ``initial password`` is the last six digits of the ID card by default. It can be modified in the official client.
- Step 3: Select your network card; generally speaking, you can use ``ip addr`` to view the network card that has been assigned an IP, such as eth1.
- Step 4: ``Start the service`` and observe whether you can access the Internet, and then enable ``scheduled startup``; because the campus network will be closed from 12:00 to 7:00 the next day.
- Finally，enjoy it!

## How to build

- First clone this repository to the package directory of the openwrt you want to compile:

```bash
## Add feed
echo "src-git zzz https://github.com/Dichgrem/luci-app-zzz.git" >> feeds.conf.default
## Update and install feed
./scripts/feeds update
./scripts/feeds install luci-app-zzz zzz
```
- Then select ``Network->zzz`` and ``LuCI->Applications->luci-app-zzz`` in make menuconfig and change them to "M" state;

- Finally, run

```bash
make package/luci-app-zzz/clean V=s
make package/luci-app-zzz/compile V=s
```

and

```bash
make package/zzz/clean V=s
make package/zzz/compile V=s
```

to start build.

- You can use this command to find the compiled packages:

```bash
❯ find bin/ -name "zzz*.ipk"
bin/packages/x86_64/base/zzz_1.0.0-r1_x86_64.ipk
❯ find bin/ -name "luci-app-zzz*.ipk"
bin/packages/x86_64/base/luci-app-zzz_0_all.ipk
❯ find bin/ -name "luci-i18n-zzz*.apk"
bin/packages/x86_64/base/luci-i18n-zzz-zh-cn_26.063.52301~6e658ac_all.ipk
```

or if you are use 25.x version:

```bash
❯ find bin/ -name "zzz*.apk"
bin/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/zzz/zzz-2.0.1-r1.apk
❯ find bin/ -name "luci-app-zzz*.apk"
bin/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/zzz/luci-app-zzz-2.0.1-r1.apk
❯ find bin/ -name "luci-i18n-zzz*.apk"
bin/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/zzz/luci-i18n-zzz-zh-cn-26.064.09925~74381fd.apk
```

## Add Feeds

Replace `ARCH` with your device architecture (`x86_64` / `aarch64_cortex-a53` / `mipsel_24kc`):

```bash
# Trust public key
wget -O /etc/apk/keys/zzz.pem \
    https://Dichgrem.github.io/luci-app-zzz/ARCH/key.pub.pem

# Add repository source
echo "https://Dichgrem.github.io/luci-app-zzz/ARCH/packages.adb" \
    >> /etc/apk/repositories

# Install
apk update && apk add luci-app-zzz
```
